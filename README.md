# Team Fortress 2 demo renaming tool 
When playing Team Fortress 2 (TF2) you can record your PoV from a match using the ingame record command. This results in a demo file that can be played back ingame. Recording demos is usually done in competitive matches as opposed to public or casual matches. To make life easier for competitive TF2 players there is a plugin to TF2 called P-REC which will record demos of competitive matches and even report at what point (i.e. at what tick) in the demo you got a kill streak. Additionally there is an option to bookmark the timestamp in a demo if something noteworthy happened (other than a kill streak typically). This information about kill streaks and bookmarks is kept in a text file which is called KillStreaks.txt by default. Over time you can stack up a ton of demos and thus many demos with kill streaks and/or bookmarks in them. This has happened many times to yours truly which inspired this tool that reads through KillStreaks.txt and renames demos from something like "20230320_2129_koth_product_final_RED_BLU" to "20230320_2129_5KS_42k_BM_90k" such that the highlights are in the demo name making it much easier to go through your highlights when playing back demos. In this particular example there is a 5 killstreak around tick 42000 and a bookmark around tick 90000.
